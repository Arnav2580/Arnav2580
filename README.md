# Arnav Goyal

Founder • Builder • Entrepreneur • Researcher
Bengaluru, India

I am a founder and college student focused on building **scalable, technology-driven products** at the intersection of **healthcare, machine learning, and communities**. I work end-to-end — from problem discovery and system design to experimentation, execution, and early go-to-market thinking.

My interests span **applied AI**, **uncertainty-aware machine learning**, and **zero-to-one product development**, with an emphasis on building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and usable in real-world settings.

## What I’m Building

### **Jeevni — Healthtech Platform**
A healthtech platform enabling **accessible, appointmentless medical consultations**, with a free entry layer and a structured premium model.

Focus areas:
- Preventive healthcare workflows
- Doctor–patient marketplaces
- Medical triage and routing systems
- Patient data pipelines and operational scalability

### **Stealth Work**

QUANTO — AI Infrastructure for the Physical Economy (Stealth)

I am currently building QUANTO, an early-stage AI infrastructure project focused on intelligence systems for physical-world operations.  
Due to its early and sensitive nature, technical details are intentionally restricted.

Documentation is available privately for academic or institutional review.

### **Event Union — Global Events Community**
A community-driven platform connecting students, founders, and professionals to events worldwide.

Designed as a **distributed, chapter-based system** (regional + global), with a long-term vision of becoming a unified discovery layer for high-quality events across domains.

## Selected Projects & Work

### **Probabilistic ML & Uncertainty**
- Built a **reproducible experimental pipeline** comparing Bayesian Linear Regression and Gaussian Processes
- Implemented calibration metrics (NLL, coverage, reliability diagrams)
- Studied **IID vs OOD behavior** and failure modes under distribution shift  
Repository: `probabilistic-ml-uncertainty`

---

### **Neuro-Symbolic & Compositional Reasoning**
- Explored hybrid approaches combining symbolic structure with neural models
- Focused on compositional generalization and reasoning-centric AI  
Repository: `neuro-symbolic-compositional-reasoning`

---

### **Applied ML & Systems**
- Implemented ML fundamentals and neural models from scratch using PyTorch
- Built applied AI systems in collaborative settings, contributing to model logic, experimentation, and system design  
Repositories: `ml-basics-pytorch`, `MOMO_AI`

---

### **Product-Oriented Systems**
- Designed and developed end-to-end systems with a focus on real-world constraints, coordination, and usability  
Repository: `CrowdCast`
